brother 
use another video .. the video u r using is tilted.. it need to be rotated by 90 degree. 
OK! Wait


Brother .. 
Speed of this will not matter. U can use any other model .. using the checkpoints of this model  traiing..  There a a model in my github.. u can tray 
with that.. u will get better speed. 


Note: 
If u give square shape images to ur model. it will give better result. 

This one you mean 

#PASCAL_VOC_ALL_CLASSES = './data/pascal_voc07_cls_names_car_person.txt'

i did it just no
w
yeash 

well!!! i did it now to givve
why ide  u 

do that!!! 

I was afraid!!! 

wait!!

after i wanted to put on normal training i wanted to see the classes so it was showing me all the classes then i tried to make some changes 
so what i did i changed the whole calsses names to preson and car classes names only thats wqhy i changed,, i didint changed it when i was teraining car
and person on ioncremnta;l or traning car only !!!
good.. now train wither car and person.. keep it as it is .. fine

but it is still showing bike and bus and train.. is that okay?
.. i filtered them in the next part. check if it contains at least one object of car or person

yes there is person or either car in the same image 
so it means it shows the bounding box of all objects when we want to show the person or car in the image.. yeah
